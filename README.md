# 👋 Hi, I’m Kilian Voillaume

Welcome to my GitHub profile. I’m **Kilian Voillaume**, a finance-focused engineer currently studying at **HEC Paris**, with a prior academic background in control and electrical engineering from **CentraleSupélec** and **ESME Sudria**. This space is a curated portfolio of self-initiated projects at the intersection of **financial theory, quantitative methods**, and **practical market applications**.

My objective is clear: to demonstrate technical depth and applied thinking across core domains relevant to **Sales & Trading**, including **derivatives pricing**, **volatility modelling**, **Monte Carlo risk analysis**, and **market microstructure**. These projects reflect how I think about markets — analytically, probabilistically, and with attention to detail.

## 🔎 Featured Repositories

### [Financial-Projects](https://github.com/KilianVoillaume/Financial-Projects)
A collection of advanced, hands-on Python implementations covering:
- **Monte Carlo simulations** for derivatives pricing
- **VaR & CVaR** models for portfolio risk
- **Variance reduction techniques** for pricing efficiency
- Tools to help price, stress-test, and visualise financial instruments

### [Financial Market Uncovered — Articles](https://github.com/KilianVoillaume/Financial_Market_Uncovered_Articles)
A series of educational and technically precise articles exploring:
- Options Greeks, implied volatility surfaces, and exotic payoffs
- Credit risk, structured products, jump diffusion, and stochastic volatility models
- Execution algorithms and market microstructure
> Each article bridges theory with practice — ideal for junior traders, quants, and curious market participants.

### [Greeks Streamlit App](https://github.com/KilianVoillaume/Greeks_Streamlit_APP)
An interactive **Streamlit dashboard** to explore and visualise:
- First- and second-order Greeks for vanilla options
- Sensitivity analysis across parameters (vol, time, rates, etc.)
- Real-time plotting of how Greeks evolve with moneyness and time to expiry
> Designed for intuitive understanding and faster option risk interpretation.
