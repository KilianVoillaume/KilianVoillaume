# üëã Hi, I‚Äôm Kilian Voillaume

Welcome to my GitHub profile. I‚Äôm **Kilian Voillaume**, a finance-focused engineer currently studying at **HEC Paris**, with a prior academic background in control and electrical engineering from **CentraleSup√©lec** and **ESME Sudria**. This space is a curated portfolio of self-initiated projects at the intersection of **financial theory, quantitative methods**, and **practical market applications**.
