# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Kilian Voillaume

I'm currently a **Finance student at HEC Paris**, with an academic background in **Control & Electrical Engineering** from **CentraleSupÃ©lec**.

## ðŸ”§ What Iâ€™m Working On

Right now, Iâ€™m building out my `financial-project` repository â€” a curated collection of **Python-based tools and notebooks** focused on:

- Derivatives pricing  
- Volatility modelling  
- Monte Carlo simulations  
- Portfolio risk management  
- Market microstructure mechanics  

All the code and analyses youâ€™ll find here have been developed independently as part of my effort to apply advanced finance theory through self-driven technical projects.
